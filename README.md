All scripts used for Nationstates should be used at the users own risk. Even the most legal of scripts can be run improperly and thus become illegal. Please make sure you read any code that you use or put your nation's name into as a user agent. Do not use any code that was given to you by people you do not know or trust even if it is created by someone you know. If you do not know how to read code talk with the developer of the code to make sure that you understand what the code is doing it is your responsibility to abide by scripting rules.
